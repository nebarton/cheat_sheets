To change terminal colors: 

Open Terminal and type nano .bash_profile
Paste in the following lines:
export PS1="\[\033[36m\]\u\[\033[m\]@\[\033[32m\]\h:\[\033[33;1m\]\w\[\033[m\]\$ "
export CLICOLOR=1
export LSCOLORS=ExFxBxDxCxegedabagacad
alias ls='ls -GFh'

Hit Control+O to save, then Control+X to exit out of nano
The first line changes the bash prompt to be colorized, and rearranges the prompt to be “username@hostname:cwd $”

The next two lines enable command line colors, and define colors for the ‘ls’ command

Finally, we alias ls to include a few flags by default. -G colorizes output, -h makes sizes human readable, and -F throws a / after a directory, * after an executable, and a @ after a symlink, making it easier to quickly identify things in directory listings.
